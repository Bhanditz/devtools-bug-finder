This documentation is for developers who want to work on the developer tools.

It was built with [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook) and dropped in this repository so it can be served online through http://firefox-dev.tools/docs.

Please refer to this [README](http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/devtools/docs/README.md) to know how to build the docs again and once done, copy the resulting files in this directory.
